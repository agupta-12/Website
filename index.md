Welcome! I'm a fifth year PhD student in the economics department at Boston University. My research focuses on organization economics, social learning, and game theory.

### Working Papers

**Incentives, Supervision, and Limits to Firm Size** <a href = "Files/Paper.pdf" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[PDF]</a> <a href = "http://ssrn.com/abstract=5182004" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[SSRN]</a>

This paper studies how incentive problems affect the size and structure of a firm (or any other organization) with one principal and many agents. We develop a model in which worker effort, supervision, and wages are determined endogenously. Our model generalizes much of the existing literature by making minimal assumptions about the production technology and the nature of supervision. Using a novel optimization technique, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the size of a firm to not be limited by incentive problems. We show that firms are limited to a positive, but finite, number of workers under reasonable assumptions. Firm size is unbounded only when worker productivity is sufficiently greater than the dis-utility of effort.


**Utility Maximization Under Endogenous Uncertainty** <a href = "Files/Note.pdf" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[PDF]</a>

This paper establishes a general existence result for optimal decision-making when choices affect the probabilities of uncertain outcomes. We introduce a continuity condition -- a version of upper semi-continuity for choice-dependent probability measures -- which ensures upper semi-continuity of expected utility. Our topological proof does not require standard assumptions such as concavity of preferences or monotonicity of outcome distributions. Additionally, we identify sufficient conditions, including continuity of densities and stochastic dominance, which allow the main assumption to be verified in relevant economic contexts. These findings expand the applicability of expected utility theory in settings with endogenous uncertainty.
